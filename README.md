# Phaser-Webpack Template
This project is just my template for getting started with new games for Ludum Dare. The project has a basic starting Phaser Scene and is setup to auto build and reload the browser using webpack.

## Getting Started
1. Install NodeJS
2. Run ```npm install```
3. Run ```./bin/run.sh```
4. Open a browser to http://localhost:9000
